# TaskManager

### Start the app

Go in my-service and `yarn && yarn start`.


Go in my-app and `yarn && yarn start`

### Algo
Favorised an algo that just by date, then by priority. The algo can be enhance if we add a "estimate time to do" for planning. This would allow putting some high priority from tomorrow in today ordering.

### Things appropriate to add that I miss time
- Paginated back-end in get Orders: because this list is ever growing.
- Add spinner on request processing
- Handle error properly (front-end and back-end)
- More unit tests
- Back-end basic Integration Test (in/out) on API call

### Code standard applied
- Integrated TS
- Prettier
- Eslint (front-end)
- Separated deps in package.json (devs vs prod)
- Choose CSS module, instead of CCS-in-JS or commin CSS.

### Notes
Took some time to learn GraphQL and implement it. Bare with me, I have no industry experience in back-end convention.
